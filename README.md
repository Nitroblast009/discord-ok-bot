# discord-ok-bot

This is a simple discord bot that is used on the JFSS Discord Server. It counts the amount of times "ok" has been said on the server and uses that count to do many things. Moreover, it also takes the last message of the day (in staff chat) and reacts to it with 1 of 10 different cookie emojis.
